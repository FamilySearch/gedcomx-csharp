# FamilySearch API SDK

This is a C# library that provides support for consuming the [FamilySearch API](https://developer.familysearch.org/).

The FamilySearch API is an implementation of the [GEDCOM X RS Specification](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx-rs),
plus some custom FamilySearch extensions. As such, the FamilySearch API SDK extends the
[GEDCOM X RS Client](../Gedcomx.Rs.Api/README.md).


# NuGet Package Information

# Use

The FamilySearch API SDK extends the [GEDCOM X RS Client](../Gedcomx.Rs.Api/README.md). In addition to the
base functionality of the [GEDCOM X RS Client](../Gedcomx.Rs.Api/README.md), the
FamilySearch API SDK provides additional model classes, convenience classes, and methods to support FamilySearch-specific
functionality.

The FamilySearch API uses [hypermedia as the engine of application state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)
and so using a client feels like browsing the web. As such, the SDK feels like using a screen scraper. The process can generally
be summarized as follows:

#### Step 1: Read the "Home" Collection
 
Web sites have a "home page". The FamilySearch API has "home collections". Examples of collections include the FamilySearch Family Tree,
FamilySearch Memories, and FamilySearch Records.

#### Step 2: Follow the Right Link

You get stuff done on a web site by following links to where you want to go. Ditto for the FamilySearch API.

#### Step 3: Repeat

Follow more links to get more stuff done.

### Read the FamilySearch Family Tree (Start Here)

Before you do anything, you need to start by reading the collection that you want
to read or update.

May we suggest you start with the FamilySearch Family Tree?

```csharp
Boolean useIntegration = true; //whether to use the integration (previously sandbox) reference.
String username = "...";
String password = "...";
String developerKey = "...";

//read the Family Tree
FamilySearchFamilyTree ft = new FamilySearchFamilyTree(useIntegration);

//and authenticate.
ft.AuthenticateViaOAuth2Password(username, password, developerKey);
```

<a name="read-person-by-persistent-id"/>

### Read a Family Tree Person by Persistent ID

```csharp
String username = "...";
String password = "...";
String developerKey = "...";

String ark = ...; //e.g. "https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/4:1:KW8W-RF8"
FamilyTreePersonState person = new FamilyTreePersonState(new Uri(ark))
  .AuthenticateViaOAuth2Password(username, password, developerKey);
```

<a name="read-person-by-pid"/>

### Read a Family Tree Person by Family Tree ID

```csharp
String pid = ...; //e.g. "KW8W-RF8"

FamilySearchFamilyTree ft = ...;
FamilyTreePersonState person = ft.ReadPersonById(pid);
```

<a name="read-pwr-by-pid"/>

### Read a Family Tree Person by Family Tree ID, Including Relationships

```csharp
String pid = ...; //e.g. "KW8W-RF8"

FamilySearchFamilyTree ft = ...;
FamilyTreePersonState person = ft.ReadPersonWithRelationshipsById(pid);
```

<a name="search-ft"/>

### Search for Persons or Person Matches in the Family Tree

```csharp
FamilySearchFamilyTree ft = ...;

//put together a search query
GedcomxPersonSearchQueryBuilder query = new GedcomxPersonSearchQueryBuilder()
  //for a John Smith
  .SetName("John Smith")
  //born 1/1/1900
  .SetBirthDate("1 January 1900")
  //son of Peter.
  .SetFatherName("Peter Smith");

//search the collection
PersonSearchResultsState results = ft.SearchForPersons(query);
//iterate through the results...
List<Entry> entries = results.Results.Entries;
//read the person that was hit
PersonState person = results.ReadPerson(entries[0]);

//search the collection for matches
PersonMatchResultsState matches = ft.SearchForPersonMatches(query);
//iterate through the results...
entries = results.Results.Entries;
//read the person that was matched
person = results.ReadPerson(entries[0]);
```

<a name="create-ft-person"/>

### Create a Person in the Family Tree

```csharp
FamilySearchFamilyTree ft = ...;

//add a person
PersonState person = ft.AddPerson(new Person()

  //male
  .SetGender(GenderType.Male)
  //born in chicago in 1920
  .SetFact(new Fact(FactType.Birth, "1 January 1920", "Chicago, Illinois"))
  //died in new york 1980
  .SetFact(new Fact(FactType.Death, "1 January 1980", "New York, New York")),
  //with a change message
  FamilySearchOptions.Reason("Because I said so.")
);
